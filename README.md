# After School Classes Web App

## Project Overview
This is a full stack web application for buying after-school classes and activities. The frontend is built with Vue.js and the backend is built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Atlas.

## FRONT END Links

- [Vue.js App GitHub Repository](https://github.com/obdaguy-create/STUDENT_PARENTS_AFTER_SCHOOL_LESSONS_FRONTEND)
- [Vue.js App GitHub Pages (Live Demo)](https://obdaguy-create.github.io/STUDENT_PARENTS_AFTER_SCHOOL_LESSONS_FRONTEND/)
   IMPORTANT!!!!:
   The GitHub Pages demo uses the CORS Anywhere proxy to bypass CORS restrictions from the backend.
   Because GitHub Pages is HTTPS and the backend is HTTP, a proxy is required.
   Before using the live demo, activate the demo server here:

### Backend (Express.js)
1. Open the `SERVER` folder.

## MongoDB Collections
- Exported `Lessons` and `Orders` collections are included in the submission zip.

## Database Seeding

- The `seed.js` script in the `SERVER` folder is used to populate the MongoDB Atlas database with the initial lessons data.
- To run the script, use:
	```
	node seed.js

- MongoDB Compass (desktop app) was used to connect to MongoDB Atlas (cloud) for data management and exporting collections.

## Postman Requests
- Exported Postman collection for all API endpoints is included in the submission zip.
